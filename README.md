# GIPHY-API

The goal of this project is to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of the user's choice using the GIPHY API, JavaScript, and jQuery to change the HTML of the site in accordance with the following requirements:

[x] Create an array of strings, each one related to a topic of interest. Save it to a variable called topics.

[x] The app should take the topics in this array and create buttons in the HTML.

[x] Use a loop that appends a button for each string in the array.

[x] When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

[x] When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate.

[x] If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

[x] Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
